# StudentSchedulerAndroidApp
This Java-written Android mobile app allows users to add, edit, and delete information related to their school terms, the courses within these terms, and the assessments within these courses. This information is stored via an internal database written in SQLite and can be viewed throughout the app's UI. The user also has the ability to add and edit notes for each course and email these notes via their phone's preferred emailing app. Furthermore, the user has the ability to set notifications directly into their phone for upcoming course start and end dates and assessment due dates.
